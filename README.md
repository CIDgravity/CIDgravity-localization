# CIDgravity Localization

This repository contains the i18next JSON localization files for the [CIDgravity application](https://app.cidgravity.com).

## How to contribute as a translator

The actual translation work happens at https://localization.cidgravity.com through our Weblate instance.

Weblate will locally commit to a feature branch every minute, then an administrator will manually push and this repository CI will trigger a pull request.

## How to contribute as a developer

Add variables by editing `./cidgravity/locales/dev/filename.json`.

If the file does not exist, create it, then create also `./cidgravity/locales/en-US/filename.json`. It must be a valid JSON file (add `{}` inside).
If you forget to create this `en-US` file, then Weblate add-on will not be able to generate the component automatically.
Our CI pipeline will fail if this condition is not respected. Install this repository's pre-commit hooks to automatically generate a valid empty JSON file in `en-US` when commiting a new file to the `dev` directory.

### `pre-commit` hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#intro)

Install it using:

```
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
```

Run

```
pre-commit install
```

to install all the configured hooks.

To change pre-commit rules, edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
